# Friday Night Funkin' - Muffin Engine

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt
...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
